Inception:

	Workaholism, Anxiety, Depression, ADHD are commonly growing terms in today's urban, technology-driven life.
	Regular health check-ups as well, tend to ignore mental health as a whole, thus curbing any scope of early diagonosis.
	Additionally, mental health is still considered as a tabboo topic in most parts of the world, raising the possibility of unavailable diagonostic information.
  
	So, is there anyway, we can at least predict an onset of any one of these issues through some available data?
	Can this data be used by an organization to check if there is any scope of resource management that can help enhance work-life balance for its potentially impacted employees?
